This is the code part of the Starburster computer, a computer that uses Starburst as its data storage mechanism. To run, just compile to your Arduino, and hook it up to the machine. Don't have one? Order one when they become avaliable from [TechShroom](http://techshroom.com)

If you don't have an Arduino, the [circuts.io](http://123d.circuits.io/circuits/96419-starburster) page will hopefully be able to help you.
